# GPhone
"Are you tired of having to equip your camera every time you want to take a picture?
Would you rather have an App that does virtually the same thing but more complicated?
Well then I present to you, the GPhone (Remade)!
The GPhone features some of the basic abilities from the original IPhone 4, excluding the most essential ofcourse!
Listen to music, browse the internet, execute order 66 and much more! (You can't actually be the senate, yet)
Get yours today, for the low, low price of eternal subscription. What a deal!
Batteries not included."
